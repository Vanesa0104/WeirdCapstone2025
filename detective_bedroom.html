        The room is large and lofty, befitting someone of royal status. 
        The windows, long and narrow, provide an undisturbed view of the 
        countryside that the Desdemona family owned, stretching on for 
        miles. Comfortless, antique furniture decorates the room. Center 
        of it all, laying on a bed fit for any king, is Mahlon. Ezra almost 
        doesn't recognize him. In his every memory, Mahlon is filled with 
        a vitality that rivalled the sun. A shining light that persisted 
        in a place determined to snuff it out. Laying there with his hands 
        folded over his chest, pale and motionless, he seems almost drained 
        of life.
