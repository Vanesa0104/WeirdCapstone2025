# WeirdCapstone2025
My capstone project is an interactive, narrative-driven experience that immerses users in a haunting narrative. Choose your archetype—Detective or Entity—and uncover secrets hidden within a dark, surreal world. There will be hidden triggers and elements within the story and it's your job to uncover them as the story is told. Headphones recommended.

## 📓 Features
- Two diverging archetypes and thier unique narratives.
  -  The detective is more immersive, riddled with subtle triggers that users must find to continue on with the story
  -  The entity employs more storytelling techniques, the triggers aren't nessecary to unveil but recommended as they make the story more immersive. Hidden ending.    
- Atmospheric visuals and audio design (headphones *highly* recommended)  
- Interactive elements and hidden triggers that reward exploration  
- Glitch effects, layered sound, and responsive UI to deepen immersion  

## 🕹️ How to Play
1. Press the speaker button the unveil the screens.
2. Choose your archetype on the landing screen. Choose wisely, you can not go back to choose another.
3. Hover, click, and explore carefully—details matter.  
4. Uncover secrets and move deeper into the story.  

## ⚠️ Note
This experience is designed for desktop and requires sound for full immersion.
Volume may be a bit low, please adjust to your liking.
A bit of a flash warning. The background may be jarring for some users.
