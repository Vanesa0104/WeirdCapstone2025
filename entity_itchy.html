      Her eyes fly open. 

      <br></br>
      
      “Elena!” Theodosia cries, searching wildly for her 
      friend, “Elena, where–!”

      <br></br>

      She freezes.

      <br></br>

      <em>N-no...</em>

      <br></br>
      Horrified, Theodosia brings her hands up to her mouth, her 
      stomach lurching.  

      <br></br>

      Only…. She looks down and realizes her hands are... stained. 
      Stained red. And in her mouth, the taste of copper lingers.

      <br></br>

      Slowly, she feels herself crouching down beside her friend. 
      She strains herself, trying to move away from her but finds she 
      can’t. She feels like a passenger in her own body, as though 
      <em>something</em> is imposing its will on her. Controlling her. 
      Resisting feels like she’s shouldering the weight of the sky. 

      <br></br>

      Sobbing, Theodosia is forced to bring her face next to her 
      friend’s corpse, her liver. 

      <br></br>

      The itch <em>burns</em>.

      <br></br>

      Against her will, she feasts on her friend. Against her will, 
      she savours every bite.

      <br></br>

      She looks up and finds a bird perched on the statue.  

      <br></br>

      Silent. Watching her.
