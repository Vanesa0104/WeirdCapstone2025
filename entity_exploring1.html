      Elena steps forward, brushing off leaves from the statue. 
      “This is definitely something,” she murmurs, circling the 
      statue. “Think it’ll be our ticket out of student debt?”

      <br></br>
      
      Theodosia crouches near the base. Symbols—maybe script—are 
      engraved in the stone, barely visible under the lichen. 
      “Think anyone knows this is here?”

      <br></br>

      “No way. There’d be signs. Excavation markers. A group of 
      archaeologists and their underpaid grad students,” Elena 
      grins, eyes bright. “This, my friend, is something 
      <em>undocumented</em>. And it’s ours for the taking!”

      <br></br>

      The thrill of discovery tugs at her, overpowering the unease 
      that lingers just under the surface. They split up, carefully 
      exploring through the clearing.

      <br></br>

      Wandering through the site, Theodosia stumbles on something 
      half-buried in the loose soil. It's a small figurine, worn 
      down and wings chipped, its features eroded by time, but she 
      thinks—Angel Gabriel?  

      <br></br>

      <em>Guess we weren’t the first to grace this site.</em>

      <br></br>

      She kneels beside it, brushing off dirt with the sleeve of 
      her jacket. That’s when she sees it, writing on the wall—lines 
      etched deep, almost desperate, looping into shapes of what she 
      thinks is some ancient language. Nothing she can read or make 
      out anyway, it’s all Greek to her.
