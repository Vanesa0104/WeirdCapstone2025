      He takes note of the cold welcome heâ€™s received in, despite having fond memories

      to the ebon floorings in every room. Gothic decorations decked every 
      inch of the manor and somber portraits hung on the walls.

      <span class="hover-trigger reveal-item" data-index="1">

      atmosphere wasnâ€™t welcoming enough, he feels a familiar shiver run 
      down his spine. As a child, heâ€™d never really been able to place a 
      name to the feelingâ€“itâ€™s only now that he recognizes it as the 
      feeling of being 
      <em>watched.</em>
