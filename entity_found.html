      Sighing, Theodosia trudges behind Elena, who shoots her 
      victorious smirk. Typical. Elena gets them lost but hey, at 
      least she found the mysterious path that’ll lead them to who 
      knows where in the forest.

      <br></br>
      
      Minutes—maybe hours—pass, time Theodosia spends trying to reach 
      out for help while Elena walks ahead, taking the occasional selfie 
      or shot of whatever catches her eye. 
      <br></br>

      “You know,” Theodosia grumbles, “if we don’t find help soon, the 
      only pictures we’ll have worth a damn are the pictures on the 
      missing person's board. Actually, at this rate, they might as 
      well skip straight to our <em>obituaries</em>.”

      <br></br>

      “Relax, would you?” Elena retorts, rolling her eyes, “They’re 
      probably already looking for us. We just need to find a clearing 
      and make a camp. We already have everything we need! Just 
      consider our camping trip a more intimate and authentic 
      experience in getting to know the local geography!”

      <br></br>

      “I reserve the right to worry when we’re lost in the middle 
      of the fucking woods”, Theodosia deadpans, refusing to admit 
      how the words ease some of the tension in her shoulders.  

      <br></br>

      It’s not long before the trees thin slightly, revealing what 
      looks like an abandoned religious site. In the center of the 
      rubble stands an old statue, half-consumed by time and vines, 
      depicting the scene of a man holding a bird, almost as though
