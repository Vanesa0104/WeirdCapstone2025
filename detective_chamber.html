      Despite himself, Ezra feels a thrill of excitement shot through him. 
      He’s not been this intrigued by a case since he first started as a 
      detective. Teeming with anticipation, 
      
      <span id="chamberTrigger" class="hover-reveal">
        he enters the chamber. 
      </span>
    </p>

      <div id="chamberButtonContainer" style="display: none; margin-top: 20px;">
        <button id="chamberButton">The door shuts itself closed behind him</button>
      </div>

    <p>
      
      The smell hits him like a punch to the stomach—thick, putrid and 
      acrid. An abominable mix of odours, alien to Ezra’s senses but 
      somehow still <em>wrong</em>.

      <br></br>
      
      Covering his nose proves futile against the reek, and it takes him 
      a moment to regain his bearings. 

      <br></br>

      He wishes he hadn’t.

      <br></br>

      The room stretches outward in a massive arc, a heavy mist clings 
      to the floor and the walls rise high and curve inward like the 
      inside of a grotesque womb. But what’s worse is—

      <br></br>

      Rows of cylindrical glass tubes are embedded in the walls, each 
      pulsing faintly with dim green light. They stretch from the floor 
      to the ceiling, stacked like coffins. Floating in the tubes are 
      figures that could have once been considered humans. Each is 
      encased in a viscous, bluish fluid—suspended motionless, with 
      cables plunged into saggy flesh. Some are naked, others in tattered 
      clothing. Each one’s face is pale, waxy, lifeless.

      <br></br>

      And yet—familiar.

      <br></br>

      There’s Mr. Claye, Mrs. Arden, and—and—dozens of others Ezra had 
      once known. Familiar faces he’d half-remembered from childhood, 
      people he’d grown up around. Neighbours, teachers, shopkeepers. 
      All of them had simply… moved away. That’s what everyone had said. 
      That’s what he’d believed.

      <br></br>

      But they hadn’t.

      <br></br>

      They were here. 

      <br></br>

      Preserved. Entombed. <em>Displayed</em>.

      <br></br>

      He staggers, blue light warping their faces into something both 
      familiar and monstrous. 

      <br></br>

      His breath catches at the sight of one of the tubes.

      <br></br>

      One of the Desdemona maids.

      <br></br>

      The woman who opened the front door when he’d first arrived 
      at the manor, greeting him with an icy glare. He’d thought it 
      strange; he’d always known her to be kind. He’d thought she’d 
      simply grown bitter with time; kindness never survived long in 
      this world. But no– 

      <br></br>

      She was here. Floating motionless with the rest of them, uniform 
      still clinging to her and her hair floating adrift. Ezra stumbles 
      back, pulse hammering in his chest.

      <br></br>

      Either something was pretending to be her.

      <br></br>

      Or something had <em>replaced</em> her.

      <br></br>

      Shuddering, he forces himself to move deeper in, the mist curling 
      around his legs thicker now, the hum of machinery louder. And then 
      he sees it.

      <br></br>

      A larger chamber opens up at the end of the corridor, lights 
      flickering to life above a single unit.

      <br></br>

      The glass is clear and pristine. Tubes dangle like vipers, hissing 
      as they pump in the thick liquid.

      <br></br>

      A nameplate gleams beneath it, freshly engraved.

      <br></br>

      “Mahlon Desdemona.”

      <br></br>

      His heart pounds against his ribs. 

      <br></br>

      Just beyond the glass, a shadow moves. Watching.
