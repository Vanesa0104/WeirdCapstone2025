      For as long as she can remember, Theodosia spent her summers 
      at her grandparents' cottage. 

      <br></br>
      
      She loved spending time there, surrounded by nature. Sheâ€™d have 
      lived there if given half a chance. She especially loved playing 
      in the woods of their backyard, always reluctant to head back 
      inside. Sheâ€™d always felt as though she belonged to the great 
      outdoors, always felt safe there.

      <br></br>

      The only time sheâ€™d felt otherwise was when she was eight years old. 

      <br></br>

      Sheâ€™s barefoot, the grass damp with morning dew as she chases 
      after a butterfly when suddenly, a black blur swoops in and rips 
      the butterfly out of the air. 

      <br></br>

      She stops cold. Looks up. 

      <br></br>

      A bird is perched on a low branch. Silent. Watching her. 

      <br></br>

      Not a crow, not a hawkâ€”something else, colossal, its feathers 
      too dark. Too still.

      <br></br>

      It doesnâ€™t move. Doesnâ€™t blink.

      <br></br>

      She takes a step back.

      <br></br>

      In the distance, she thinks she hears her mother calling. 
      She doesnâ€™t dare look away from the bird.

      <br></br>

      If she didnâ€™t know any better, sheâ€™d swear it <em>grinned</em>.

      <br></br>

      A beat passes.

      <br></br>

      The bird lifts itself into the air and disappears from view.
