    <h2>The Detective.</h2>
    
    <p>
      Itâ€™s a gloomy day when Ezra gets the first letter. The clouds 
      hung oppressively low in the sky. The morning air carried with 
      it a chill that persisted from the early hours and refused to die.

    <br></br>  
      
      Itâ€™s from his old friend, Mahlon Desdemona. He hasnâ€™t heard from him 
      in years. Though once as close as brothers, they drifted apart when 
      Ezra decided to move west, where the bustle of city life provided him 
      an escape from the quiet monotony of the countryside.

    <br></br>
      

      The letter was filled with pleasantries and fond reminiscences but came 
      attached with a request to visit his familyâ€™s estate, for he had a favour 
      he dared not ask of anyone else. Anyone else and Ezra mightâ€™ve tossed the 
      letter into the fire to use as kindling to stave off the morning chill. 
      But this was his old friendâ€” the same prideful boy whoâ€™d sooner fall off 
      his horse than ask for a helping hand. 
    
      <br></br>

      The first letter alone would have gotten Ezra on an eastbound carriage, 
      but shortly after the first letter, another two followed in its wake. 
      The second letter came from the same sender as the first. Only unlike 
      the elegant calligraphy of the first, it seemed as though Mahlon had 
      written to him in urgent haste, as though pressed for time. To add to 
      its strangeness, the letter spoke of how he should disregard his latest 
      request, that there was no need to make the long journey. Faced with 
      such contradiction, Ezra paused; long enough that he barely managed to 
      receive the last letter before departing east. This letter came from 
      an entirely new senderâ€“a maid by the name of Gabrielleâ€“writing to tell 
      him that Mahlon had suddenly fallen into a deathlike sleep.
